When you create a game in GameMaker: Studio and export it, GameMaker: Studio exports the game code as bytecode instead of native compiled code, and that bytecode is compatible with any other GameMaker: Studio runner (also known as YoYo runner), as long as they have matching GameMaker: Studio versions. This is similar to how Java applications work.

This is how projects such as [Droidtale](https://mrpowergamerbr.com/projects/droidtale) (which was also made by yours truly) can exist. We exploit that GameMaker: Studio games compile to bytecode, which means they can be ran on *any* platform that has an official runner for it!

Ever since I created Droidtale 10+ years ago, I had that lingering thought in my mind... If GameMaker games use bytecode, what prevents us from creating our *own* runner? And if we can write our *own* runner, what prevents us from porting GameMaker: Studio games to other platforms?

And that's where Butterscotch comes in! Butterscotch is an open source re-implementation of GameMaker: Studio's runner.

## Game Compatibility

Butterscotch's goal is to be able to have Undertale v1.08 (GameMaker: Studio 1.4.1804, Bytecode Version 16) fully playable. But we do want to support more GameMaker: Studio games in the future too!

While our target is Undertale v1.08, that doesn't mean that other games CAN'T run in Butterscotch! Because Butterscotch is a runner and not a Undertale port/remake, you CAN run other GameMaker: Studio games with it and, as long as the game is compiled with GameMaker: Studio 1.4.1804 and they only use GML variables and functions that Butterscotch supports, it should work fine.

Of course, there are exceptions that break game compatibility altogether:

* Games compiled with YYC, because they use native code instead of bytecode. 
* Games compiled with the new [GMRT](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMRT-Beta/tree/main), because they use native code instead of bytecode.

## Supported Platforms

* Linux (GLFW, OpenGL)
* Windows (GLFW, OpenGL, MinGW)
* PlayStation 2 (ps2sdk, gsKit)
* Haiku (GLFW)
* ...and maybe more in the future!

## Community Ports

* [Xbox 360 (Butterscotch-360)](https://github.com/ceilingtilefan/Butterscotch-360) by @ceilingtilefan
  
## Building Butterscotch

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DPLATFORM=glfw -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

If you are using CLion, set the platform in `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `CMake` and add `-DPLATFORM=glfw`

Then run Butterscotch with `./butterscotch /path/to/data.win`!

## CLI parameters

The GLFW target has a lot of nifty CLI parameters that you can use to trace and debug games running on it.

* `--debug`: Enables debugging hotkeys
* `--screenshot=file_%d.png`: Screenshots the runner, requires `--screenshot-at-frame`.
* `--screenshot-at-frame=Frame`: Screenshots the runner at a specific frame. Can be used multiple times.
* `--headless`: Runs the runner in headless mode. When running in headless mode, the game will run at the max speed that your system can handle.
* `--print-rooms`: Prints all the rooms in the `data.win` file and exits.
* `--print-declared-functions`: Prints all the declared functions (scripts, object events, etc) in the `data.win` file and exists.
* `--trace-variable-reads`: Traces variable reads
* `--trace-variable-writes`: Traces variable writes
* `--trace-function-calls`: Traces function calls
* `--trace-alarms`: Traces alarms
* `--trace-instance-lifecycles`: Traces instance creations and deletions
* `--trace-events`: Traces events
* `--trace-event-inherited`: Traces event inherited calls
* `--trace-tiles`: Traces drawn tiles
* `--trace-opcodes`: Traces opcodes
* `--trace-stack`: Traces stack
* `--trace-frames`: Logs when a frame starts and when a frame ends, including how much time it took to process each frame.
* `--always-log-unknown-functions`: When enabled, Butterscotch will always log unknown functions instead of logging them once per script.
* `--always-log-stubbed-functions`: When enabled, Butterscotch will always log stubbed functions instead of logging them once per script.
* `--exit-at-frame=Frame`: Automatically exit the runner after X frames.
* `--speed`: Speed multiplier
* `--seed=Seed`: Sets a fixed seed for the runner, useful for reproduceable runs.
* `--print-rooms`: Prints all rooms to the console, along with all objects present in the room.
* `--print-declared-functions`: Prints all declared GML scripts by the game
* `--disassemble`: Dissassembles a specific script
* `--record-inputs`: Records user inputs
* `--playback-inputs`: Playbacks user inputs
* `--debug`: Enable debug features

## Debug Features

When running Butterscotch with `--debug`, the following hotkeys are enabled:

* `Page Up`: Moves forward one room
* `Page Down`: Moves backwards one room
* `P`: Pauses the game
* `O`: While paused, advances the game loop by one frame
* `F12`: Dumps the current runner state to the console
* `F11`: Dumps the current runner state to the console (JSON format), or dumps it to a file if `--dump-frame-json-file` is set.
* `F10`: Sets the `global.interact` flag to `0`. Useful in Undertale when you are moving through rooms and one of them starts a cutscene that doesn't let you move.

## Performance

Performance is pretty good on any modern computer, but when running on low end targets (like the PS2) it is *very* slow when there's a lot of instances on screen, or when a instance does a for loop.

## Then why not have a transpiler?

The issue with a transpiler is that, if you try transpiling the game in the "naive" way, that is, emitting VM calls like it was the original bytecode, you won't get any 
*improvement* from it, you would need to create a *good* transpiler that actually transpiles it into *good* code, and that's way harder.

Having a transpiler also have other disadvantages:

1. You lose the ability of debugging the runner at a "high level" by tracing opcodes.
2. Compilation is SLOW, transpiling Undertale in a naive way to C and building it takes 90 seconds on a modern computer, and building it to other targets is so slow that I wasn't even able to test it.
